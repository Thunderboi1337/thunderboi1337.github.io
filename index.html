					<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Marcus Robertsson, and in this portfolio, I share
						my personal projects along with smaller experiments where I test features in, Python, C/C++,
						microcontrollers and a tiny amount of Assembly code for fun. I've also taken the liberty to
						include some
						of
						my school projects and
						assignments. To distinguish between my side projects and school projects, I've dedicated the <a
							href="Education.html">Education</a> page to display my academic work.
						To provide a clear view of what we tackled in school and what I enjoy exploring in my free time.

					<p>"This is a Game" is a simple 2D game where you play as a knight armed with a machete, fending
						off
						endless waves of slime attacks. Survive as long as you can while slashing through hordes of
						enemies in this fast-paced survival game.

						Made it in ubuntu and havn't had the time to test for windows. So might not work there. But
						will
						be added the the far far future</p>

					<p>üîß I've recently completed a course focused on the design of PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards).
						My
						background in school gave me a solid understanding of circuit operation and basic
						electronics,
						but I quickly realized there was a significant gap in my practical knowledge when it came to
						designing boards. Now, having finished the course, I feel much more confident in my ability
						to
						create my own PCBs and design specific circuits for my projects. The hands-on experience has
						been invaluable, and I'm excited to apply these new skills to future endeavors</p>

					<p>This is a straightforward MQTT client that sends two pieces of information: üí° light levels
						and üå°Ô∏è temperature readings.

						I did this project to get some hand on MQTT time, was try to get a good feel of how it
						works.

						This client was used on a Eps32.

						This client was specifically set up to connect with a Mosquitto broker, The broker was set
						up on
						my pc üì∂üîå</p>
